Goals:

- offer 1k storage to anyone
- no user accounts or registration
- space is assigned based on pub/priv key interactions
- api-style endpoints that allocate a space for you based on the hash of your pubkey
- private key sign transactions to the api for CRUD of your 1k
- ability to set mime-type of your 1k

**WARNING: The keys `ex_private.pem` and `public.pem` exist solely to serve as placeholders during testing. Do not use them in a setting where security is needed!**
